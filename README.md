# Numfacts

Numfacts is a small demo console application I wrote to familiarize myself with C# .net. Simply run it from the command line to get a fact about a number of your choosing. Alternatively you can request a fact about a random number. 

## Usage
    numfacts [number] [attributes]

    Attributes:
        /m - Request a math fact.
        /t - Request a trivia fact.
        /r - Choose a random number

A functioning version of the program can be found in the /bin folder. Otherwise you'll need to sign up for an API key using the link above. Add it to the Constants/APIConstants.cs file.
